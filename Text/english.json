  {"key":"TALK_BROWNBEAR_HOME_01","value":"Your weapons don't look like a Friend skill. They're powered by Sandstar, but... who made them?"},
  {"key":"TALK_BROWNBEAR_HOMEAP_00","value":"We're disbanding the Cellien Hunters. Now we'll turn up the heat and rescue animals around the park!"},

  {"key":"TALK_ANOTHERSERVAL_HOMEAP_02","value":"But you're here now. You're real. You won't disappear anymore. Reality is better than any dream."},

  {"key":"TALK_FOSSA_HOMEAP_00","value":"The Jungle's peaceful again. I guess you aren't just the Savanna Troublemaker anymore."},

  {"key":"TALK_TAMANDUA_GET","value":"Ah, no, I wasn't scared!"},
  {"key":"TALK_TAMANDUA_HOME_00","value":"It seems there's a shortcut to the jungle depths near the area entrance."},

  {"key":"TALK_SCARLETIBIS_GET","value":"Oh, what a relief. I've heard the mountaintop café is in trouble too, so please help them."},
  {"key":"TALK_SCARLETIBIS_HOME_00","value":"Listening to Ibis eases my pain. I think it's because of the amulet you have."},

  {"key":"TALK_SCARLETIBIS_HOMEAP_00","value":"I can sing as loud as I want and Celliens won't attack me! This is the best!"},
  {"key":"TALK_ORYX_DUNGEON","value":"Insect-shaped Celliens? The general never mentioned that..."},
  {"key":"TALK_ORYX_GET","value":"I came to check out the Desert and found this mess. What's happening to the park?"},
  {"key":"TALK_ORYX_HOME_00","value":"Evasion is important in combat. Dodge an attack, and you'll have a chance to counter."},
  {"key":"TALK_ORYX_HOME_01","value":"Celliens have taken the plains and the castle, but we won't let them have the library."},
  {"key":"TALK_ORYX_HOMEAP_00","value":"The general wants to go travelling. I'll stay by her side, wherever she goes."},
  {"key":"TALK_ELEPHANT_DUNGEON","value":"Such a beautiful place. It's a shame I can't take my time dancing through the water."},
  {"key":"TALK_ELEPHANT_GET","value":"Thank you. I ran away from the Jungle area, but it's dangerous here as well."},
  {"key":"TALK_ELEPHANT_HOME_00","value":"I'll be safe here. I'll stay until the Jungle area is restored."},
  {"key":"TALK_ELEPHANT_HOME_01","value":"I feel calm in places that smell like paper. Why?"},
  {"key":"TALK_ELEPHANT_HOMEAP_00","value":"I'm glad the park is safe. With all the new friends I've made, it's more fun than ever."},
  {"key":"TALK_AXISDEER_DUNGEON","value":"The soil here is... sweet?"},
  {"key":"TALK_AXISDEER_GET","value":"I came to see the house that some Friends built nearby... you'd better be careful, too."},
  {"key":"TALK_AXISDEER_HOME_00","value":"Beaver and Prairie have built a house here as well! It's amazing!"},
  {"key":"TALK_AXISDEER_HOME_01","value":"The lake water and the soil were strangely sweet. Sort of like Japari Buns..."},
  {"key":"TALK_AXISDEER_HOMEAP_00","value":"The Professor said the soil was sweet because of the Sandstar from the Celliens."},
  {"key":"TALK_PORCUPINE_DUNGEON","value":"Eep! Celliens aren't supposed to have stabby needles!!"},
  {"key":"TALK_PORCUPINE_GET","value":"I've travelled a lot, but those are the most complicated Cellien forms I've ever seen."},
  {"key":"TALK_PORCUPINE_HOME_00","value":"General Moose will flatten the Celliens! She's invincible!"},
  {"key":"TALK_PORCUPINE_HOME_01","value":"The Celliens didn't pay much attention to me. Are they're focusing on you, Serval?"},
  {"key":"TALK_PORCUPINE_HOMEAP_00","value":"The Celliens were interested in Serval because of her tremendous power!"},
  {"key":"TALK_AUROCHS_DUNGEON","value":"Um, weapons in your east hand, the sun rises on the right... Uh-oh, I'm lost!"},
  {"key":"TALK_AUROCHS_GET","value":"You've saved me! It's an area I'm familiar with, but I still got lost. That could have been bad."},
  {"key":"TALK_AUROCHS_HOME_00","value":"General Lion is strong! She might act scary, but she cares about her friends more than anyone."},
  {"key":"TALK_AUROCHS_HOME_01","value":"I've been really on edge... But I'm not afraid of the Celliens."},
  {"key":"TALK_AUROCHS_HOMEAP_00","value":"The \"magnetic field\" is back. Whatever it is, it'll keep me from getting lost again!"},
  {"key":"TALK_CHAMELEON_DUNGEON","value":"The library is the only safe haven in the forest... I must report this to the general."},
  {"key":"TALK_CHAMELEON_GET","value":"My color-changing stealth technique will keep me safe, but other Friends may be in danger."},
  {"key":"TALK_CHAMELEON_HOME_00","value":"The Chameleon's medicine is invaluable when you seek to avoid confrontation."},
  {"key":"TALK_CHAMELEON_HOME_01","value":"My scouting suggests the purple and dark blue Celliens are especially powerful."},
  {"key":"TALK_CHAMELEON_HOMEAP_00","value":"I plan to teach ninjutsu to other Friends and create my own ninja village. It will be an interesting endeavor."},
  {"key":"TALK_ARMADILLO_DUNGEON","value":"I'll defeat the Celliens myself! "},
  {"key":"TALK_ARMADILLO_GET","value":"It was too much for me to handle on my own. I'm really good at defending, though."},
  {"key":"TALK_ARMADILLO_HOME_00","value":"Even the strongest defense won't help if acid burns through it. Be careful."},
  {"key":"TALK_ARMADILLO_HOME_01","value":"The soil has felt strange lately. It's lumpy, but also kind of squishy..."},
  {"key":"TALK_ARMADILLO_HOMEAP_00","value":"The soil is back to normal again. The Celliens were to blame! Thank you for fixing it!"},
  {"key":"TALK_SHOEBILL_DUNGEON","value":"(Staaaaaaare...)"},
  {"key":"TALK_SHOEBILL_GET","value":"...Um, thank you. I was looking for a chance to run, but I got surrounded..."},
  {"key":"TALK_SHOEBILL_HOME_00","value":"(Staaaaaaare...)"},
  {"key":"TALK_SHOEBILL_HOME_01","value":"...I want to be better at talking to people. I'm sure there are other Friends who feel the same."},
  {"key":"TALK_SHOEBILL_HOMEAP_00","value":"You caught up with a long lost friend, right? I'm glad... I want to talk to my friends, too."},
  {"key":"TALK_GIANT_DUNGEON","value":"Just like I thought, \"that incident\" was only a sign of what was to come."},
  {"key":"TALK_GIANT_GET","value":"Hey! Long time no see, Serval... Oh, you've never met me before. Hehehe..."},
  {"key":"TALK_GIANT_HOME_00","value":"There were no humans in the Gokoku region, right? Just like I thought. Hehehe..."},
  {"key":"TALK_GIANT_HOME_01","value":"The Lucky Beasts have security levels. If you become the Board Chairman, you can access anything you want."},
  {"key":"TALK_GIANT_HOMEAP_00","value":"Long time no see, Cellval! Sorry I thought you were Serval this whole time. Good job getting your memory back!"},
  {"key":"TALK_CAPYBARA_DUNGEON","value":"So cold... life flashing... before my eyes..."},
  {"key":"TALK_CAPYBARA_GET","value":"It was so cold... Thanks for rescuing me..."},
  {"key":"TALK_CAPYBARA_HOME_00","value":"Spas are the best... It's not a hot spring, but it still feels great..."},
  {"key":"TALK_CAPYBARA_HOME_01","value":"All I wanna do is bathe, eat Japari Buns and brush my teeth... dental health is important, folks..."},
  {"key":"TALK_CAPYBARA_HOMEAP_00","value":"I'm glad the hot springs are back... good health and peace are what's best in life."},
  {"key":"TALK_TAPIR_DUNGEON","value":"This lodge might have a secret somewhere..."},
  {"key":"TALK_TAPIR_GET","value":"Yikes! ...Oh, you saved me? Thanks. Maybe you don't have any secrets..."},
  {"key":"TALK_TAPIR_HOME_00","value":"This library might have a hidden secret... or maybe the park itself?"},
  {"key":"TALK_TAPIR_HOME_01","value":"I'm glad I have friends in lots of regions... life in the library isn't bad, either."},
  {"key":"TALK_TAPIR_HOMEAP_00","value":"The park had secrets after all... but maybe the occasional mystery added to the fun."},
  {"key":"TALK_AARDWOLF_DUNGEON","value":"Where am I? What's that monster? I'm scared..."},
  {"key":"TALK_AARDWOLF_GET","value":"O-Oh, thank you. I was scared... M, My name is... I don't know..."},
  {"key":"TALK_AARDWOLF_HOME_00","value":"The Professor says I'm an Aardwolf. Could you please be my friend...?"},
  {"key":"TALK_AARDWOLF_HOME_01","value":"Sand Cat is sharing her cave with me. Being in a cave calms me down..."},
  {"key":"TALK_AARDWOLF_HOMEAP_00","value":"I lost my memory after a Cellien attack. But when the night sky lit up, I remembered everything!"},
  {"key":"TALK_DOLPHIN_DUNGEON","value":"What's this big triangle thing?! This island has Celliens AND cool stuff!"},
  {"key":"TALK_DOLPHIN_GET","value":"Hi again, Serval! I heard there was a red pond here and came to swim in it, but loads of Celliens showed up."},
  {"key":"TALK_DOLPHIN_HOME_00","value":"This island has more Celliens than anywhere else. Is it because of the mountain eruptions?"},
  {"key":"TALK_DOLPHIN_HOME_01","value":"I saw a tree on a nearby island that reached the sky! I bet Serval can jump over there if she tries!"},
  {"key":"TALK_DOLPHIN_HOME_02","value":"I wanna go further out to sea someday! But I get weak when I'm too far from the island."},
  {"key":"TALK_DOLPHIN_HOMEAP_00","value":"I can swim anywhere now! I'm gonna travel all around the world! YAHOO!!"},
  {"key":"TALK_NANA_HOMEAP_00","value":"Sandstar is falling from the sky and turning humans and animals into Friends worldwide. I'm a Friend, too!"},
  {"key":"TALK_NANA_HOMEAP_01","value":"We have small bodies, but we're smarter and stronger than grown adults. Work that used to take a week gets done in two days..."},
  {"key":"TALK_NANA_HOMEAP_02","value":"Thinking about it, maybe Sandstar is why the anti-Cellium filter was suddenly completed 30 years ago."},
  {"key":"TALK_MIRAI_HOMEAP_00","value":"I'm so happy to see Friends again! It's a miracle that I'll never have to say goodbye to anyone anymore."},
  {"key":"TALK_MIRAI_HOMEAP_01","value":"Friends of the same species are already quite common. We have three human Friends right here, in fact."},
  {"key":"TALK_MIRAI_HOMEAP_02","value":"My hair's been like this since I came to the park. Maybe it's from being close to Friends for so long."},
  {"key":"TALK_MIRAI_HOMEAP_03","value":"Thirty years ago, I fought with the board chairman. I thought it was wrong to abandon the park and our Friends."},
  {"key":"TALK_MIRAI_HOMEAP_04","value":"I didn't know the future she was afraid of actually \"happened\"... 30 years later, we finally made up."},
  {"key":"TALK_KAKO_HOMEAP_00","value":"I met my late parents! They were already reborn as girls. The sadness of separation is a thing of the past!"},

She was found wearing an oxygen tank-like device, stating \"I found it at the facility they sent me to.\" The tank contained considerable amounts of Sandstar.

The other was discovered by Mirai in February, at the Sandstar Volcano in the Kyoshu region. By studying these samples, the Japari Park R&D has successfully created an artifical ACF.

  {"key":"DOC_09_05","value":"Experiment 2\nProcedure: The artificial ACF was turned on and 5 mL of Sandstar-Raw was added to the culture fluid.\nResults: The Sandstar-Raw rapidly decreased in purity and decayed into Sandstar, which soon dissipated. The Euglena in the culture fluid was unchanged."},
  {"key":"DOC_09_06","value":"Experiment 3\nProcedure: The artificial ACF was turned on, and Dr. Kako placed 200 mL of Sandstar-Raw on her left hand.\nResults: The experiment was aborted because the research assistant stopped Dr. Kako."},
  {"key":"DOC_09_07","value":"Experiment 4\nProcedure: A wooden mannequin was placed in a water tank, resting on a hydraulic press. The artificial ACF was turned on, and 200 mL of Sandstar-Raw was applied to the mannequin's head."},
  {"key":"DOC_09_08","value":"Results: The mannequin's head was engulfed with Sandstar-Raw. This spread across the entire body, and a large eye formed on its head. The mannequin started moving and attacking the tank, so the press was activated to destroy it."},

  {"key":"DOC_09_10","value":"The complete amulet's filtering capability is extremely powerful, and can theoretically withstand 100% pure Cellium.

I will offer you everything I know about the incidents that brought us here."},
  {"key":"DOC_10_03","value":"The park has come under attack by Celliens twice in the past. In the first incident, the Celliens took my Sparkle and left me comatose. Thanks to the efforts of Friends, I was able to recover. During that incident a Cellien transformed into a Friend named Cellval."},
  {"key":"DOC_10_04","value":"Cellval lived peacefully with the other Friends. However, sensing a forthcoming eruption of the Sandstar volcano, she went missing. We later learned that she had constructed an anti-Cellium filter on the volcano's summit - aided by the four Guardian Beasts Suzaku, Byakko, Genbu and Seiryu - to prevent a massive Cellien outbreak. Unfortunately the exertion forced the Guardian Beasts back into statue form, while Cellval turned into an anti-Cellium crystal."},
  {"key":"DOC_10_05","value":"Then came another volcanic eruption. This knocked the filter (composed of the Four Gods' lithographs) out of alignment. A large wave of Celliens was born, along with a Colossal-class Cellien. The park guide Mirai-san worked alongside the Friends to repair the filter, cutting off the Celliens' self-healing capability, then defeated the Colossal Cellien by leading it to the river and destroying its stone."},
  {"key":"DOC_10_06","value":"The Sandstar volcano might erupt again. But there are even bleaker possibilities. There is far more Cellium beneath the surface than would be released in any eruption. Also, because the Cellium has transformed the volcano's magma pool, similar phenomena could spread to other volcanoes. In the worst case scenario, the entire mantle may have already turned into Cellium. At that point it's no longer the park in danger, but the entire Earth."},
  {"key":"DOC_10_07","value":"The Lucky Beasts have no capability to protect Friends from Celliens. They can only deliver medicines or Japari Buns. So I slipped two exploits into the depths of their programming. The first will modify the items Lucky Beast sells to guests when certain computers are activated. The second - if you consider Lucky Beast to be a close friend, you'll discover it on your own."},
  {"key":"DOC_10_08","value":"With the cooperation of a Serval Cat Friend, we also developed Friend-specific weaponry.

  {"key":"DOC_14_02","value":"Friends are sometimes referred to as \"the mystery you can meet\". Japari Park, famous for its collection of Friends, says that the Sandstar that turns animals into Friends \"fell from the sky\". Some experts have argued that it is a volcanic product, and the park has concealed this fact to avoid frightening guests. However, our editorial department discovered a shocking truth from one of the park's former staff members."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_03","value":"\"Sandstar is indeed a volcanic product, but the soil around the crater of Sandstar volcano contains high volumes of iridium.\"\nFor those unaware, iridium is a metallic element most prominently found in the Earth's mantle and meteorites. The Sandstar volcano must be connected to one of these two biomes; either way, the claim that Sandstar \"fell from the sky\" is at least technically correct."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_04","value":"Our editor-in-chief, owner of a private space telescope, commented that \"Sandstar must be an evolution-promoting substance that came from space.\" Bacterial samples were discovered 3 years ago on Saturn's moon Enceladus, but there was no sign of complex life. Perhaps that was due to the lack of Sandstar."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_05","value":"A theory that's gained traction recently is the idea that the Earth's core is a storage device of sorts. The Earth came into existence over 4 billion years ago, but the inner core is much younger; only 700 million years old, by current estimation. The Cambrian explosion, in which countless lifeforms evolved hard tissue all at once, occurred about 540 million years ago."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_06","value":"Compared to the evolution of prokaryotes to eukaryotes, which took billions of years, the evolution of life since the birth of the inner core has progressed at a tremendous speed. Could the inner core have affected the Earth's magnetic field, letting in cosmic rays that encouraged the mutation of DNA? In addition, the inner core isn't just a lump of simple iron and nickel. Its density is slightly below what would be expected of such an alloy."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_07","value":"Could there be a cavity in the inner core? Our editor-in-chief, who once voyaged in a mantle exploration vessel, says that \"the inner core must be a storage device for recently deceased souls. It lets them out to be reincarnated once they've internalized the knowledge of their past life.\" Memories of a former life may have promoted the evolutionary arms race, and led us to the world we have today."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_08","value":"Is the government at odds with Japari Park over the recent Friend abduction case? On May 6th, the Park Ethics and Security Office held a sudden press conference. They announced that a Serval Cat Friend had been abducted from the park on March 20th. They crime was attributed to Faust, a religious organization advocating for \"the ascension of human civilization via Sandstar\". However, this announcement has left many with unanswered questions."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_09","value":"Why did the park take over a month to announce a Friend had been abducted? They said the Friend escaped on her own, but how could a Serval Cat Friend - a non-aquatic animal - cross the sea to find her way back to the park? Even before that, it's well known that Friends regress into animal form when their Sandstar supply is depleted. How could she have survived outside of the park for over a month?"},
  {"key":"DOC_14_10","value":"Our editor-in-chief, who raises her child with an animal-eared android nanny, says \"The park is keeping info on Friends confidential. They're afraid the government wants to use Friends for military purposes. In the first place, isn't it suspicious that a Friend was abducted at all?\" It seems that religious sects aren't the only groups fascinated by the supernatural power of Sandstar."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_11","value":"Our editor-in-chief's private space telescope has captured a shocking image. We have discovered a bizarre planet whose surface is covered with eye-shaped patterns.

Without official support, she took it upon herself to name this discovery the \"Planet of Eyes\"."},
  {"key":"DOC_14_12","value":"Why has mankind been unable to make contact with intelligent life beyond Earth? One theory suggests the existence of a Great Filter that destroys any civilisation that becomes sufficiently advanced. Since the Planet of Eyes is within the sun's habitable zone, it may have harboured intelligent life at one point. If that is the case, these eye-shaped patterns may be the work of the Great Filter."},

  {"key":"DOC_20_02","value":"It's still unclear why Celliens choose to attack Friends. However, as a park guide, I've spent a lot of time working alongside many Friends. In that time, I've come to a few conclusions of my own. I'd like to offer my thoughts on the matter."},
  {"key":"DOC_20_03","value":"It's well known that animals become Friends upon contact with Sandstar. However, if Sandstar was truly falling at random, you would expect larger and more prevalent animals to make up the majority of Friends. Yet smaller and rarer animals seem just as likely to make the transformation. Even fossils from extinct species and statues based on unknown lifeforms can become Friends."},
  {"key":"DOC_20_04","value":"As a general rule, there can only be one Friend of each species at a time. Until a Friend is eaten by a Cellien and returns to animal form, Sandstar will not strike an animal of the same species. There are exceptions for similar animals who vary greatly in appearance, such as the Jaguar and the Black Jaguar."},
  {"key":"DOC_20_05","value":"Most bizarrely, a Friend's form is affected by both their ecological characteristics and how they are perceived by humanity. For example, the Golden snub-nosed monkey Friend resembles the character Son Goku from Journey to the West. It's thought this is due to the urban legend that \"Son Goku was modeled after the golden snub-nosed monkey\"."},
  {"key":"DOC_20_06","value":"Additionally, Friends born near human settlements come into the world already clothed. Based on these facts, it's likely that Friends aren't simply \"humanized animals\". They may instead be animals that incorporate ideas from human imagination."},
  {"key":"DOC_20_07","value":"As for the subject of Celliens... they attack Friends and humans, but show little interest in other animals. They can become larger to overpower Friends by absorbing Sandstar-Raw in the air, but their goal doesn't seem to be the Sandstar itself. I once theorized that \"Celliens attack Friends to consume their Sandstar\", but that hypothesis doesn't explain why Celliens would also attack humans."},
  {"key":"DOC_20_08","value":"The question is this: what can the Celliens obtain most efficiently by attacking Friends and humans? Rather than attacking animals, what can be obtained in large quantities by changing animals into Friends and letting them live like humans before eating them? ...It's hard to explain, but there is a concept we refer to as Sparkle. Could Sandstar simply be a container for that Sparkle?"},
  {"key":"DOC_20_09","value":"Why is there only one Friend per species? This is just a theory, and the very thought of it makes me shiver, but... Someone may be choosing targets to hit with Sandstar in order to gather as much Sparkle as possible. The Celliens may be using Japari Park as their personal farm."},
  {"key":"DOC_20_10","value":"The Cellien Queen was defeated, but Friends are still born \"by design\". This is too convenient for the Celliens to be merely coincidence. Therefore... I think there's another Cellien out there even more powerful than the Queen."},

  {"key":"DOC_21_04","value":"On the cover story [Mother of the current board chairman]\nThe founder of Japari Park is Ineko Kitsunezaki. She was born in A.P.27. In A.P.70, she bought the Japari Islands, formed near the Ogasawara Islands, for about 4 trillion yen. She invested a further 6 trillion yen to rapidly develop the area. Three years later she opened Japari Park, which aimed to gather animals from all over the world."},
  {"key":"DOC_21_05","value":"True background\nIt is true that Kitsunezaki was involved in purchase negotiations and development plans for the Japari Islands.

  {"key":"DOC_23_03","value":"On the cover story [Japari Park Destroyed By The Queen]\nThe Queen is the leader of the Celliens. Cell Harmony refers to the directional negentropy rays emitted by a Queen with \"Specialness\", or the events caused by them. Celliens exposes to these rays \"evolve\" rapidly."},
  {"key":"DOC_23_04","value":"The Queen has no inherent Specialness. During the Park Central attack, a Serval Cat used Specialness to activate \"Kemo Harmony\", but that Specialness was stolen by a Cellien. Afterwards, the Queen absorbed most of the Specialness from that Cellien and gained the ability to trigger Cell Harmony."},
  {"key":"DOC_23_05","value":"The rays of Cell Harmony typically have a limited range of influence. However, by using the Specialness-touched Cellien as a focus, the rays were amplified and diffused. Ultimately Cell Harmony engulfed the entire park, causing all its Celliens to evolve and robbing the area of its Sparkle."},
  {"key":"DOC_23_06","value":"The truth of Cell Harmony\nThe above scenario is only half of the full story. Once Japari Park is overrun with evolved Celliens, the park itself will become a giant tuning fork. Calculations suggest this amplification will increase Cell Harmony's range to over 1000 kilometers."},
  {"key":"DOC_23_07","value":"Computer simulations predict that once Cell Harmony reaches Honshu, it will trigger the Cellium lying dormant in several active volcanoes, including Mt. Fuji. This will generate a large number of Celliens, which will then evolve and consume the mainland. Honshu itself will become the Celliens' next tuning fork."},
  {"key":"DOC_23_08","value":"The process will continue to cascade, activating Cellium stores in volcanoes across the planet. Celliens will overrun all of Earth, evolving endlessly through Cell Harmony. Eventually the Earth itself will be deprived of Sparkle, and be turned into a planet-sized Cellien."},
  {"key":"DOC_24_01","value":"<align=\"center\">[Confidential] On the Entropy-Decreasing Phenomenon \"Kemo Harmony\"</align>"},
  {"key":"DOC_24_02","value":"Kemo Harmony is a phenomenon where an animal reduces the entropy of itself and other animals. This effect can overcome the laws of thermodynamics. It was first observed during the Park Central attack, where a Serval Cat Friend was receiving treatment at Kemono Hospital. She used Kemo Harmony to instantly heal the hospital's patients, which understandably surprised and intrigued the park staff."},
  {"key":"DOC_24_03","value":"Later, 3 terms were coined based on general rules from Cellien interaction. These terms are \"Sparkle\", \"Specialness\" and \"Miracle\". Once the Queen's incident was resolved, the characteristics of Friends and Celliens were investigated and these terms were scientifically redefined."},
  {"key":"DOC_24_04","value":"Sparkle: Concepts with relatively low entropy. Examples include memory, language, self-esteem, and happiness. A state with memory has lower entropy than a state without memory. A language with advanced grammar has lower entropy than the barks of an animal. The same is true for high and low self-esteem, or joyful and lonely moods."},
  {"key":"DOC_24_05","value":"Specialness: The ability to increase or decrease entropy without external exchange. Sparkle is usually created and maintained by giving entropy to others. Humans possess more Sparkle than animals because they exclusively output entropy to other organisms and the environment. An individual with Specialness ignores this rule, and can increase or decrease entropy freely."},
  {"key":"DOC_24_06","value":"Miracle: A general term for events where the entropy manipulation of Specialness is prominently displayed. This can involve the reduction of entropy (turning water into wine, healing an injury or illness by touch alone) or the increase of entropy (calming storms, killing trees)."},
  {"key":"DOC_24_07","value":"Kemo Harmony is a kind of Miracle. When an animal with Specialness strongly desires an increase in Sparkle (i.e. a decrease in entropy), its own Sparkle and the Sparkles of others nearby are amplified via the collective unconscious. For example, the injuries of many nearby animals can be instantly healed along with a sudden surge of courage."},
  {"key":"DOC_24_08","value":"Only a few people in human history have ever had the power to perform Miracles at will. However, given the case of Serval's Kemo Harmony, we can assume that several individuals - humans included - hold the potential for Specialness. These people may still need a mental trigger of some sort in order to actually perform a Miracle."},
